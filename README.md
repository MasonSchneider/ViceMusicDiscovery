# Vice Music Corner Discovery

## Design

The goal of this site is to be simple, useful, and quick to find any song heard on Vice. The main design will be a website that uses Javascript to pull JSON into a format for browsing and searching. Organization of listings will be key.

## Development

### Setup

This application is a simple static page. Use "npm install" to get http-server onto your host and then "npm run serve" to have the website available at localhost:8080.

## How to Update

New episodes should be added to the schedule.json file. These should be in order with the most recent episode at the top of the list.
